  <p>The Git Version Control System has taken over most of the Ruby world. Simply put, if you&#8217;re going to develop with Ruby you have to learn Git.</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>A full Git tutorial is beyond scope here, but there are many great resources out there:</p>

<ul>
<li>ProGit by Scott Chacon is available free online: <a href="http://progit.org/book/">http://progit.org/book/</a></li>
<li>Help.GitHub: <a href="http://help.github.com/">http://help.github.com/</a></li>
<li>PeepCode&#8217;s Git Video: <a href="http://peepcode.com/products/git">http://peepcode.com/products/git</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Why Git Is Great</h3>

<p>If you aren&#8217;t used to version control then the whole concept of merging can feel like magic.  If you are used to tools like Subversion (SVN), then you have developed a (necessary) fear of the conflicts that can come up.  It might take a few tries to get used to the idea, but branching and merging with Git is amazing!  Here&#8217;s the basic idea:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start with an existing repository</li>
<li>Create and checkout a branch</li>
<li>Commit your work to that branch</li>
<li>When the branch is ready, merge it back into the known version you started with.</li>
</ol>

<p>That&#8217;s the simplest case, and it works every time.</p>

<h4>Multiple Branches</h4>

<p>Where it gets more complex is when there are multiple branches out at the same time:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start with an existing repository branch</li>
<li>Create and checkout a local branch</li>
<li>Commit your work to that local branch</li>
<li>&quot;Jim&quot; comes along and creates his own local branch from the same original branch</li>
<li>He commits on his branch, finishes his work before you do, and merges it back into the &quot;shared&quot; original</li>
<li>When your branch is ready, you merge it back into the known version you started with.</li>
<li>You commit a little bit more work to your branch and go to merge it back into <code>master</code>&#8230; but wait!  Jim&#8217;s code is in there!  What happens?!?  One of three things:

<ul>
<li>It just works.  You and Jim worked on different files, and the changes just merge together with no issue.</li>
<li>It just works, version #2.  Even though you and Jim touched the same file, maybe even the same line of code, git was able to merge the changes.</li>
<li>Git merges 99% of the work, but realizes it isn&#8217;t smart enough on one piece of code&#8230; maybe you changed a variable name Jim refactored away.  It alerts you.  You fix this problem, run your tests, commit the change, and continue with the merge.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>That last part is what causes nightmares in people that come from other version control tools, but in git there is a lot less pain associated with it.  Because Git tracks <em>changes</em>, and not <em>versions of files</em>, there is a subtle but powerful difference in the quality of information you have to help resolve the conflict.</p>

<h4>More Advanced Management</h4>

<p>Just about anything you can imagine is possible with git. Want to rewrite the commit history? Do it. Want to pretend you branched off Jim&#8217;s code instead of <code>master</code>? Use <code>rebase</code> and make it so. Git was written and is used to control the Linux kernel source code which involves tens of thousands of contributors &#8211; whatever you need for <em>your</em> project can happen!</p>

<h3>Managing Development and Releases</h3>

<p>Beyond the tool itself, you need a strategy for managing a Git repository. In general:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do not develop any code on the <code>master</code> branch, only merge in other branches</li>
<li>Create a new local branch for every feature</li>
<li>Merge and prune branches when the feature is done</li>
<li>Do not check in code unless the tests are passing</li>
</ul>

<p>While those guidelines can get you started, you should consider a robust release management process outlined in extensive detail here: <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/</a></p>

<p>If that sounds appealing, then you can run the process using GitFlow (<a href="https://github.com/nvie/gitflow/">https://github.com/nvie/gitflow/</a>). There is a great introduction tutorial to using GitFlow put together by Dave Bock at CodeSherpas here: <a href="http://codesherpas.com/screencasts/on_the_path_gitflow.mov">http://codesherpas.com/screencasts/on_the_path_gitflow.mov</a></p>

<p>Alternatively, you can follow GitHub&#8217;s own, more streamlined, git workflow: <a href="http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html">http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html</a></p>

<h3>GitHub</h3>

<p>Git is great, but GitHub is totally amazing. If there is any way for you to use GitHub, do it. If you&#8217;re developing open source, then the free public repositories are fine. If you need some privacy, individual and organization accounts provide private repositories for a few dollars a month. And if you need more comprehensive security, consider GitHub:FI (<a href="http://fi.github.com/">http://fi.github.com/</a>) which you can run on your server inside your firewall. </p>

<p>GitHub supports code review, collaboration, and organization tools that are completely game changing.</p>
