* Use test-driven development
* Demonstrate mastery of all parts of the Rails stack

## Expectations

* Work on the exercise described below for 50 minutes with your facilitator
* The facilitator may change the tests or ask additional questions to assess your understandings/skills
* As you work, you *should*:
  * Think out loud so your facilitator can understand your process
  * Ask questions of your facilitator
  * Reference external public resources (ie: Google, Ruby API, etc)
  * Use the tooling most comfortable to you (Editor/IDE, testing framework, support tools like Guard, etc)
* As you work, you *should not*:
  * Copy code snippets other than those present in this description
  * Seek live support from individuals other than your facilitator
* After you complete the exercise, please use discretion with your classmates to allow them an authentic evaluation experience

## Preparation

Before the session starts:

* Have the [display driver installed](http://www.displaylink.com/support/mac_downloads.php)
* Clone the repo from GitHub: [scrabble-web](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/scrabble-web)
* Run `bundle` to install dependencies
* Run the test suite (`bundle exec rake test`) and see that it has several pending tests
* Setup any external tooling you want (your editor, etc)

## Feature Description

For this exercise, the features will be driven by the test suite embedded in the repository.
