## `Enumberable`

The granddaddy of it all. The `Enumerable` module can be mixed into any class which implements an `each` method. Most any class that acts like a collection will mixin `Enumerable`, so it's methods are some of the most valuable you can study.

You'll find that most `Enumerable` methods work with blocks. The method generally iterates through the collection, runs the block once for each element, then does _something_ with the results.

The full API is at [http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Enumerable.html](http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Enumerable.html).
