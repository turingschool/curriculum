## `grep`

This method is a searching chainsaw. It's a little different from `select` in that it can take a "pattern" argument which is a Regular Expression or a Range. It will return an array of the matching elements.

These synonym methods will return an array of elements for which the block is true. It'll still be an array even if only one element was found.

```ruby
%w{ant bear cat bird}.grep /b/
#=> ["bear", "bird"]
```

Here the regular expression matches all words containing a `b`. Where it gets interesting is if you also pass in a block, you get a result that's similar to calling `select` to pick elements, then `collect` to run an operation and gather the results.

```ruby
%w{ant bear cat bird}.grep(/b/){|word| word.length}
#=> [4, 4]
```

The results, `[4, 4]`, are the lengths of `"bear"` and `"bird"`.
