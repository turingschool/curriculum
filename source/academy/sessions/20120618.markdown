1. Single Responsibility per Application
2. Use of well-defined communication point(s) between apps
3. Use of Ruby wrappers to encapsulate separations

##### B. Testing

1. Numeric Ruby test coverage
2. General testing style

4. Tests at multiple abstraction levels
5. Testing all parts of the application (Ruby, JS, etc)

##### C. Tools & Style

1. Rails MVC - right work in the right place
2. Attention to security
3. Using external gems effectively
4. Cane/Reek automated metrics
5. Ruby style & SRP

### Full-Group Demos

#### Demo Process

Here's a general outline for demo sessions:

* ~8 minutes of feature demo led by project team
* ~13 minutes of review groups using the app
* 4 minutes for grading / form entry

Make sure to show off what makes your application interesting. If you imployed some advanced security protection, show it off. Great performance? Prove it.

#### Demo Evaluation

It's really important that you understand the "scale" of grading:

* 1: Poor, you'd be embarassed
* 2: Not great, you'd feel a little sad
* 3: Average, did what you're supposed to do
* 4: Wow, something you're really proud to show off
* 5: Mind blowing, how did you possibly pull this off?

Please don't grade inflate -- this is supposed to be *better* than college.

Try out all the features as best you can. If it hooks up to external services, hook it up to your account and try it out!
