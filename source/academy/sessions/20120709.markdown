For your final project we'll adopt DonorsChoose as the core of our work. Each group of four will spend 2.5 weeks building a project which tries to answer a business need of the organization.

#### Project Timeline

* 7/11 - Plans Approved
* 7/17 - Technical Check-In
* 7/19 - Direction & UX Check-In
* 7/23 - Final Check-In

#### Project Process

* Teams are generated (below)
* Teams will...
  * choose a business need
  * draft three ideas
  * pitch them to the class
* Final idea will be selected by votes from your peers and Jeff/Matt
* Teams will create goals, stories, iterations, and have them approved Tuesday afternoon

#### Business Needs

DonorsChoose wants to increase the total funding delivered to classrooms. Here are a few vectors of attack:

##### Donors Funding Projects

1. Donors are very proud of their donations. It would be great for them to get some extra recognition within their social and/or professional circles. How could we recognize their past giving through Facebook, LinkedIn, etc? Anything beyond just a straight history? Total impact?
2. There are a significant number of donors who joined to donate to a specific project -- they had a personal connection to it. How do we build on that connection to get them interested in other projects?
3. For repeat donors, how do we streamline the process? How little work could we make it?
4. People come to the front page, say from something a friend told them or some media exposure, and they have a "cold start." How do we help them find the projects they're interested in? Some way it could be fun? What are their passions/interests?
5. How can we help advocate donors to leverage their social and personal networks to generate more donations?

##### Teachers Posting Projects

1. Amazon will likely become an important source for most of our projects. How can we make the "shopping" process super easy for our teachers?
2. How can we leverage historical data to help teachers write better proposals? For example, can we predict how likely a proposal is to be funded based on content, size, and location?
3. Many times teachers don't realize that their friends and colleagues have posted projects on DonorsChoose, now or in the past. How can we help them connect, share tips, etc?

#### Teams

### JavaScript Object Model

### JavaScript Patterns & CoffeeScript

### Reading Plan

Let's go through a one-week reading cycle, selecting a book today and finishing it for next Monday.

#### Selection

While you may select your book, please pick something tied to one of the following areas (in order of my preference):

1. Design (UX, UI, etc)
2. Business / Product Development
3. Code Design

Ideas:

* Design List: http://amzn.com/w/248IA5JJO0OSM
* Business (not all apply): http://amzn.com/w/352340EAXDDSF
* Programming: http://amzn.com/w/K7D6CDDMZG6S

_Please keep in mind that a technical book will be very difficult to digest in a week!_

#### Deliverable

Next Monday, you'll give a 3-5 minute lightning talk about your book, reflections, and learnings.
