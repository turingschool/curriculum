## Daily Outline

* Warm-up
* Class: Practical File/Folder Organization
* Class: Environment, Editor, and Tooling
* Project: SalesEngine Work Time

## Warm-Up

At 8:50 we will release today's warm-up.

This should get you the assignment:

```sh
$ cd path/to/warmup-exercises
$ git pull --rebase upstream master
```

(Note that you don't need to clone or fork or anything, since that's already done).

To get the test at 9:15, commit or stash your changes, and do another git pull.

```sh
$ git commit -m "Add solution to assignment 3"
$ git pull --rebase upstream master
```


## Class: Practical File/Folder Organization

What you're starting with:

* `data` folder -- don't change
* `lib` folder -- most of your classes
* `test` folder -- all your tests and any support files
* `Gemfile` -- add any dependencies
* `Rakefile` -- define automated tasks

We'll worry about the details of how the test suite will execute your code next week. For now, we'd recommend you:

* Create `sales_engine.rb` definining the `SalesEngine` class in the root directory. It should also `require` any files in `lib/`.
* Create child classes in the `lib` directory, like `Merchant` and `Invoice`
* Create tests in `test/`
* Create a `test/test_helper.rb` to define common setup bits for your tests
* If you need/want sample data for use in your tests, create a `test/support/`

## Class: Git & GitHub for Pairs

* Reviewing git remotes
* Create a `.gitignore` to ignore irrelevant files like `.DS_Store`
* Also, you can ignore `.DS_Store` globally:

```
git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore
echo .DS_Store >> ~/.gitignore
```

* `master` branch should always be runnable
* Only commit to master when a feature is "done" - written & tested
* Create and use feature branches
  * `git branch` to display branches
  * `git branch feature_name` to create a branch
  * `git checkout feature_name` to actually switch to that branch
  * `git checkout -b feature_name` to create the branch and switch to it all in one move
  * Do you work, commit code to the branch
  * `git push origin feature_name` to push the branch to GitHub (assuming GH is your `origin`)
* Merge features into master
  * `git checkout master`
  * `git merge feature_name`
  * If you get "merge conflicts", you'll have to figure them out manually. Run `mergetool` and you'll get a GUI that is really helpful.
  * `git push origin master`
* Rebasing
  * YAGNI for now

## Class: Classes, Objects, Instances, and Methods

```ruby
class Date
  def self.parse(input)
    # Turn an input string like '5/12/2013' into a ruby Date object
  end

  def day
    # Tell me what day of the week this instance of Date represents
  end
end

d = Date.parse("5/12/2013")
d.day
```

## Class: Environment, Editor, and Tooling

### Unix Tools

* `ls`
* `mkdir`
* `cd`
* `echo`
* `cat`
* `touch`
* `tail`

### Customizing Your Terminal

* Open `~/.bash_profile` in a text editor (ex: `subl ~/.bash_profile` or `nano ~/.bash_profile`)
* Check out dotfiles on GitHub: http://dotfiles.github.com/

* `export` for environment variables
* `alias` for shorthand commands
* `source` to run other scripts of bash commands

Some snippets from my `.bash_profile`:

```
export PS1="\W \[\033[0;33m\]⚡\[\033[0;39m\] "
export CLICOLOR=1
export LSCOLORS=ExFxBxDxCxegedabagacad
export EDITOR='/Applications/Sublime\ Text\ 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl -w'
export CC=/usr/local/bin/gcc-4.2

# My general projects directory:
alias cdp="cd /Users/jcasimir/Dropbox/Projects/"

# My most commonly used project, "curriculum":
alias cdc="cd /Users/jcasimir/Dropbox/Projects/curriculum/source"

# Use "be" instead of "bundle exec"
alias be="bundle exec $1"

# Use "e" and a folder/file to launch SublimeText
alias e="/Applications/Sublime\ Text\ 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl $1"

# Enable git's tab-completion library
source /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/git-completion.bash
```

### SublimeText Settings

* "Settings - Default" versus "Settings - User"
* Some recommended settings:

```
{
  "font_size": 16.0,
  "tab_size": 2,
  "translate_tabs_to_spaces": true,
  "save_on_focus_lost": true,
  "hot_exit": false,
  "remember_open_files": false,
  "ensure_newline_at_eof_on_save": true
}
```
