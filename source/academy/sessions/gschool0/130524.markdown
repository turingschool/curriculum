## Open Source, YA, Project Brainstorming

Today let's get some great work done, quickly. Choose from the following:

### Open Source

* Have you found bugs or outstanding issues with one of the API gems you're using?
* Want to write warm-up exercises for our group?
* Solve one of the warm-up exercises using JavaScript, CoffeeScript, or Elixir and put together an explanatory blog post
* Write a tutorial about a technology you're working with or have had trouble with.
* Other ideas of your own :)

### YA Work

Just 10 days until we debut the finished goods. Is it coming together? Have you integrated photos? Written notes/tutorials about how to maintain the site over time? Get it ready for hand-off.

### Project Brainstorming

On Tuesday you'll begin your individual project. There are some small constraints on the project structure/content that we'll discuss Monday.

Today, brainstorm **what do you want to learn** during the individual project, rather than thinking about what you want to build. Other points to keep in mind:

* It's a programming project, not a design project. Make sure there's some challenge in the programming, not just creating a brochure site.
* You only have about 9 days. While you should dream big, start to think about what an MVP would look like. Then how could you build on it?
* You're welcome to build a project that interacts with others' projects. What interesting ideas could you come up with?
* Many teams skated through FeedEngine without creating an API of their own. In the individual project, everyone needs to build an API and gem.

If you're going to work on these ideas I recommend you gather with two classmates to talk about and refine your ideas.

## Retrospective

### Personal Writing

Please spend the first 30 minutes of this session, writing and posting an article on your class blog reflecting on one or more of the following questions:

#### FeedEngine

* Were you happy with your final product? 
* No application is perfect, but did it adequately represent your team's three weeks of work? 
* What parts were harder than expected? Easier?
* How did it deepen or change your opinions on APIs?
* Given that experience and Chris' talk today, what ideas will influence your design of your own APIs in the future?

#### Independent Project

* What general domain are you thinking about?
* What problem within that domain do you want to try and solve?
* What external data or services will you make use of?
* What problems or limitations do you think you'll run into?

### Team Retro

Please gather in your FeedEngine teams for the next 20 minutes and discuss.

* Organization: Did you organize the project effectively? What parts of organization worked well, and what was a mess?
* People: Did work get divided up fairly (not necessarily equally)? If not, why? 
* Individual performance: Did people deliver on what was expected of them? Who overperformed and who underperformed?
* Skill development: What are you better at, now, after the project?
* Roadblocks: What kept you from doing your best work?
* If you were going to use this group for the next team project, what would you want to be the same and what would you want to be different?

### Group Conversation

* Individual Project
  * What problem do you want to solve?
  * 1 new technology?
  * What are your areas of emphasis?
  * Most nervous about?
  * Most excited about?
* The Weekend
