* [JSAttend](projects/jsattend.html) - An introduction to Ruby for new programmers doing "Extract-Translate-Load" operations against a large dataset.
* [JSTwitter](projects/jstwitter.html) - A second introductory Ruby tutorial building a rudimentary Twitter client

### Rails

* [JSBlogger](projects/jsblogger.html) - A first Rails project, exploring REST, basic associations, basic templating, etc.
* [JSMerchant](projects/jsmerchant.html) - A second level Rails project with more complex relationships, techniques. **Needs major revisions**

## Paths

Paths are groupings of tutorial topics, generally put together for an event or class.

* [Advanced Patterns with Ruby and Rails](paths/codemash_patterns.html), a four-hour tutorial used at CodeMash 2012
* [Two-Day Advanced Rails](paths/advanced_rails_two_day.html), a collection of topics centered around building better/faster Rails applications. **Work In Progress**
