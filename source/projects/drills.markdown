## Drills

_Practice makes perfect._

Learning to program is a long journey. Additionally, no amount of instruction can truly teach you how to program. At the end of the day it's up to us to put in the time and the practice required to truly internalize the lessons we're being taught.

With that in mind, our focus for this first week will be on practice and repetition. This collection of exercises is designed to give you guided practice and practical exposure to the concepts being discussed in our introductory lessons.

### Projects

#### From the Ruby Exercises repository

The **[Ruby Exercises](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-exercises)** repository is a GitHub repo where Turing stores a collection of exercises designed to give students guided practice with fundamental concepts.

**First**, follow the instructions in the repository's [README](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-exercises/blob/master/README.md) to get it set up on your machine.

**Then**, work through these exercises from the repo:

* Core Types
* Command/Query
* Mythical Creatures
* Objects and Methods
* Comparisons
* Mutation

#### From the Challenges repository

The **[Challenges](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges)** repository contains a large collection of programming exercises of varying degrees of complexity. During the week, you need to complete these exercises from that repository:

* [Collections](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/collections.markdown)
* [Deaf Grandma](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/deaf_grandma.markdown)
