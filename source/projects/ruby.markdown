### Setting up Ruby and Rails

Check out our [tutorial to setup Ruby 1.9.3 and Rails 3.2.2 on OS X, Linux, or Windows]({% page_url topics/environment/environment %})

### Ruby

* [Ruby in 100 Minutes]({% page_url projects/ruby_in_100_minutes %}) - Your first exposure to Ruby, focusing on the most important concepts and syntax elements.
* [EventManager]({% page_url projects/eventmanager %}) - An introduction to Ruby for new programmers doing "Extract-Translate-Load" operations against a large dataset.
* [JSTwitter]({% page_url projects/jstwitter %}) - A second introductory Ruby tutorial building a rudimentary Twitter client

### Rails

* [Blogger]({% page_url projects/blogger %}) - A first Rails project, exploring REST, basic associations, basic templating, etc.
* [JSMerchant]({% page_url projects/jsmerchant %}) - A second level Rails project with more complex relationships, techniques. **Needs major revisions**

### Independent Work Projects

#### Ruby

* [EventReporter]({% page_url projects/event_reporter %}) - A follow-up to EventManager focusing more on Ruby object decomposition and working with Command Line Interfaces and program control flow.
* [SalesEngine]({% page_url projects/sales_engine %}) - This project supplies a set of CSV datafiles and challenges you to build a query/reporting API. It's an excellent opportunity to practice TDD and manipulating collections. Also, several developers have used it as a test-bed for performance ideas like threads, distributed Ruby, and integrating with a SQL database.

#### Rails

* [StoreEngine]({% page_url projects/store_engine %}) - A very challenging first Rails project, it represents 2-3 weeks work for a pair of new Rails developers. You're challenged to build a fully functioning online store with products, categories, a cart, login/permissions, checkout, etc.
* [SonOfStoreEngine]({% page_url projects/son_of_store_engine %}) - A three week project working with a "legacy" codebase adopting a version of StoreEngine that you didn't write. You're challenged to add new features like multi-tenency, products being in and out of stock, subdomains, and serving requests in under 100ms.
* [FeedEngine]({% page_url projects/feed_engine %}) - You're probably familiar with [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com). In this project you're challenged to build a service that can post text, image, and link content like Tumblr. But it also needs to hook into a user's Twitter, Instagram, and Github accounts to pull content from those services. Oh, and you'll need to build an API and accompanying rubygem so your background workers can run independent from the primary application.

### Paths

Paths are groupings of tutorial topics, generally put together for an event or class.

* Beginner Level
  * [One-Day Introductory Ruby]({% page_url paths/ruby_one_day %}) -- Ruby for beginners including "Ruby in 100 Minutes" and "EventManager"
  * [One-Day Introductory Rails]({% page_url paths/rails_one_day %}) -- Rails for beginners with "Blogger"
* Advanced
  * [Advanced Patterns with Ruby and Rails]({% page_url paths/codemash_patterns %}) -- a four-hour tutorial used at CodeMash 2012
  * [Advanced Rails - Two-Day]({% page_url paths/advanced_rails_two_day %}) -- a collection of topics centered around building better/faster Rails applications.
  * [Advanced Rails - Five-Day]({% page_url paths/advanced_rails_five_day %}) -- a large collection of topics walking through everything from model construction to testing techniques to performance metrics.


### Topic Tutorials

A collection of about 50 tutorials on special topics, more specific and generally more advanced than the tutorials. These are the building blocks used to create the Paths above and Hungry Academy curriculum.
