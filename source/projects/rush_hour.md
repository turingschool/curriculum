title: Rush Hour

## Abstract

In this project you'll use Ruby, Sinatra, and ActiveRecord to build a web traffic tracking and analysis tool.

RushHour will be an application that aggregates and analyzes visitor data from another website. A RushHour customer/client will embed JavaScript in their website that will gather and send their visitor data to our site. It is important to note that we will not be creating this JavaScript. Instead we will simulate the process of gathering and receiving data, which we will call a payload. Our job is to build the application that can accept the submission of these payloads, analyze the data submitted, and display it through a HTML interface.

This is similar to how a tool like [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/) might work. When you visit a page that has Google Analytics installed, you don't necessarily see any indication of that on the page, there's just a script that runs in the background and sends your information to Google. We're building the part of the app that receives that information (in the Google Analytics example, this would be on a Google server somewhere), and then displays the information to 'users', which in this case means businesses that pay for the analysis we provide. **In the past we have heard that students aren't clear on what they're building until part way through this project, so please ask questions if this is at all unclear.**

At a high level, our project will develop along the following path:

* Iterations 0 - 3: Setting up the database, creating methods that can analyze information saved directly to the database from the test environment.
* Iterations 4 - 5: Setting up a way for the application to receive requests over the internet to create new clients and receive data ('payloads') from client sites.
* Iterations 6 - 8: Setting up a place for clients to see a summary and analysis of the information we've collected

We will use pre built payloads to simulate the gathered data from a customer/client's website. They will look like this:

```
payload = '{
  "url":"http://jumpstartlab.com/blog",
  "requestedAt":"2013-02-16 21:38:28 -0700",
  "respondedIn":37,
  "referredBy":"http://jumpstartlab.com",
  "requestType":"GET",
  "eventName": "socialLogin",
  "userAgent":"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_8_2) AppleWebKit/537.17 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/24.0.1309.0 Safari/537.17",
  "resolutionWidth":"1920",
  "resolutionHeight":"1280",
  "ip":"63.29.38.211"
}'
```

The payloads are in a hash-like format called JSON. You will need to learn how to interact with JSON in ruby. Find the Ruby JSON docs [here](http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0/libdoc/json/rdoc/JSON.html).

RushHour will simulate sending these requests using a cURL command. This is a command we can run in our terminal that sends an HTTP request. You can checkout the details of the cURL command by running `curl --manual` in your terminal.


## Learning Goals

* Understand how web traffic works
* Dig into HTTP concepts including headers, referrers, and payload
* Design a normalized SQL-based relational database structure
* Use ActiveRecord to interface with the database from Ruby
* Practice fundamental database storage and retrieval
* Understand and practice HTTP verbs including GET, PUT, and POST
* Practice using fundamental HTML and CSS to create a usable web interface

## Getting Started

### Define the Relationship with your group

DTR with your group [here](https://gist.github.com/case-eee/38e212c799c563f58766128b5057858a). One group member should send a link of the forked gist to your anchor as soon as it's complete.

### Clone the Project

1. One team member forks the skeleton repository at [https://github.com/turingschool-examples/rush-hour-skeleton](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/rush-hour-skeleton)
2. Add the other team members as collaborators
3. Add instructors as collaborators

### Requirements

The project must use:

* [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/)
* [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) (this is configured for you)
* [ActiveRecord](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html)

You'll want to set up the [DatabaseCleaner](https://github.com/DatabaseCleaner/database_cleaner) gem in order to have a clean database each time you run tests. Follow the instructions for setting up the gem. Due to a bug in the most recent version of the gem, you'll need to use this line when you set the strategy in your test helper file:

```ruby
  DatabaseCleaner.strategy = :truncation
```

See the "Resources" section at the bottom of this page for additional helpful documentation.

Before starting, make sure you have the [Postgres App](http://postgresapp.com/) installed.

### Restrictions

The project may not use:

* `Rails`

Do not name a table/model UserAgent, you will be using a gem later in the project with that same name and will have class conflicts.

## Instructions

Iterations 0-8 must be completed to consider the project complete. Please use TDD every step of the way. Tests are expected for all features and all the models - including iterations 0-1.

* __NOTE__ - Some of the work done in early iterations of this project may not make it into the final production code. And that's ok - it's to be expected that early work in most projects may not make the final cut.


## Base Expectations:

### Iteration 0

The core idea behind RushHour is that your application will store and analyze data from a clients website about visitors to their site. For iteration 0 let's begin by storing some of that data.

To store data with ActiveRecord/Postgresql we need to create migrations and a model for a particular resource. In this example we have a Payload resource, so we need a ```Payload``` model, and a migration that will create a ```Payload``` table with the necessary attributes.

Our payload looks like this:

```
payload = '{
  "url":"http://jumpstartlab.com/blog",
  "requestedAt":"2013-02-16 21:38:28 -0700",
  "respondedIn":37,
  "referredBy":"http://jumpstartlab.com",
  "requestType":"GET",
  "eventName": "socialLogin",
  "userAgent":"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_8_2) AppleWebKit/537.17 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/24.0.1309.0 Safari/537.17",
  "resolutionWidth":"1920",
  "resolutionHeight":"1280",
  "ip":"63.29.38.211"
}'
```

* Create a migration that creates a ```Payload``` table that has a column for each of the attributes.

**Important Note:** In order to prepare the test database, you may need to run `rake db:test:prepare`

Now that we have a database table for the ```Payload``` we start with our model.

Let's create a new file within our model directory - `payload.rb`. Don't forget to inherit from `ActiveRecord::Base`. The start of the file should look something like this:

```ruby
class Payload < ActiveRecord::Base

end

```

If we didn't inherit from ActiveRecord::Base we wouldn't get the ActiveRecord database query methods that are nice and easy to work with.

Now that we have a Payload model started, finish it off by creating validations for the Payload attributes.

* All the attributes must be present in the request.

You can use ActiveRecord's [validations feature](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html) to make sure no record is saved without having all attributes present.

**Be sure to have a test for each individual validation.**


### Iteration 1


Now that we have our basic database design in place, we can see that it isn't quite normalized. Our ```Payload``` violates _normal form_ and is structured in a way that will generate a lot of repetitive data. What's __normal form__ you ask? You can learn more [here.](https://gist.github.com/Carmer/f9e060bf1ac30e3ab7b3) Extract the data necessary to normalize the database so far. Do this by creating migrations, models and establishing appropriate relationships between models.

[This tool](http://ondras.zarovi.cz/sql/demo/) is a database modeling tool that can help you quickly design and iterate on your database design.

**Hint**: Any data that will be repeated in a significant amount of rows in your `payloads` table should probably be extracted to its own table. 

For example, how many different `requestType`'s will we have? We could have "GET", "POST", "PUT", and "DELETE" stored in this field. Because we're most likely going to repeat this over and over, we can extract it to a `request_types` table and then create a connection between the two tables via a foreign key in the `payloads` table. 

Don't forget to validate each field's presence that you feel is absolutely necessary.


### Iteration 2

Hopefully our database design is looking better. Now, let's start to manipulate some of that data we're storing.

We want to analyze all the payloads for the following stats. Some methods will be built directly on the Payload model, while other methods will be built __in the most appropriate class__. For example:

```ruby
class Url  < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :payloads

  def self.most_to_least_requested
    #implement this method :)
  end
end
```

* Average Response time for our clients app across all payloads
* Max Response time across all payloads
* Min Response time across all payloads
* Most frequent request type
* List of all HTTP verbs used
* List of URLs listed form most requested to least requested
* Web browser breakdown across all payloads (userAgent)
* OS breakdown across all payloads(userAgent)
* Screen Resolutions across all payloads (resolutionWidth x resolutionHeight)

Our client also finds it valuable to have stats on specific URLs. For a **specific** URL, let's find the following stats:

* Max Response time
* Min Response time
* A list of response times across all payloads listed from longest response time to shortest response time.
* Average Response time
* List of HTTP Verb(s)
* Three most popular referrers
* Three most popular user agents. We can think of a 'user agent' as the combination of OS and Browser.

### Iteration 3

Now that we've set up a basic app that can store data from a client, let's expand the functionality so we can support multiple clients.

We already have a `Payload` model and database table, and we know that a `Payload` will belong to a `Client`, and a `Client` will have many `Payloads`. That means we need to figure out a way to store `Client` data and somehow relate that to our `Payload` data.

A Client has two attributes, an `identifier`, and a `rootUrl`.

* **identifier** is akin to a username (e.g. `jumpstartlab`). This will be unique in the universe of our app (no two clients should have the same identifier).
* **rootUrl** is the site that our client wants us to track (e.g. `http://jumpstartlab.com`). There will likely be many sub-pages that a client wishes to track (e.g. `http://jumpmstartlab.com/blog`), but for a single client they will all share the same **rootUrl**.

Create migrations to do the following:
* Create the `Client` table with the necessary attributes
* Create a migration to add a reference to the `Client` on the `Payload` table. This migration will establish the one-to-many relationship that `Payload`s and `Client`s have.

Now that we have a place to store out client data, make sure you go into the models and establish the relationships between `Payload`, and `Client`, and you set up appropriate validations for the `Client`.

Join the client table with its resources. For example:

```ruby
class Client < ActiveRecord::Base
  #More Code Here
  has_many :payloads
  #More Code Here
end
```

If your schema utilizes a join table to connect resources, make sure you remember to link the resources with `:through`. For example, a `Client` may have many `request_types` through `payloads`. Take a look at [this documentation on active record associations](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html#the-has-many-through-association) to get it to work.

### Iteration 4

Now let's get into the nitty gritty that is the internet. Currently our app works by feeding it data directly, but that's not how we plan for it to be used in the real world. We want our app to be accessible by feeding it data from an external client/source.

First, let's have clients register their application by submitting a post request to the following address:

```
http://yourapplication:port/sources
```

so while you're in development it will looks something like this:

```
http://localhost:9393/sources
```

The parameter that we will require a client to pass will be:

* identifier
* rootUrl

We can send a request with this specific information via the Terminal and the `curl` command. Check out how to use the `curl` command via your Terminal by typing `man curl`. This will bring up the manual for `curl`.

We will send a request like this:

```
$ curl -i -d 'identifier=jumpstartlab&rootUrl=http://jumpstartlab.com'  http://localhost:9393/sources
```

Wondering what `-i` and `-d` mean? Check the manual.

A "POST" to `http://yourapplication:port/sources``` will require one of three possible responses from our application.

* 1. Missing Parameters - 400 Bad Request

If missing any of the required parameters return status `400 Bad Request` with a descriptive error message.

Wondering how to send back a status code from a Sinatra app? Check out the [Sinatra docs](http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro.html).

* 2. Identifier Already Exists - 403 Forbidden

If that identifier already exists return status `403 Forbidden` with a
descriptive error message.

* 3. Success - 200 OK

When the request contains all the required parameters return status `200 OK` with the following data for the client:

```
{"identifier":"jumpstartlab"}
```

* identifier - the unique identifier for the application that has been created for the client.

### Iteration 5

After completing iteration 4, we can now register Clients and their applications. However, there is still no way to get their data into our application. Let's change this by adding an endpoint (route) for Clients to post their payload data.

A registered application will send `POST` requests to the following URL:

```
http://yourapplication:port/sources/:IDENTIFIER/data
```

IDENTIFIER, in this URL, is the unique identifier for the client.

If you recall from iterations 0 and 1 we've already structured our app to accept payload data. If everything was set up correctly we should not need to change much if anything for this to work with the payload being sent over HTTP.

Everything sent over HTTP by nature is a string. That makes JSON structure perfect for sending data over HTTP. We will send our payload request as a parameter called 'payload' which contains the payload as JSON data.

Here is an example of sending a payload to our application:

```
curl -i -d 'payload={"url":"http://jumpstartlab.com/blog","requestedAt":"2013-02-16 21:38:28 -0700","respondedIn":37,"referredBy":"http://jumpstartlab.com","requestType":"GET","eventName": "socialLogin","userAgent":"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh%3B Intel Mac OS X 10_8_2) AppleWebKit/537.17 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/24.0.1309.0 Safari/537.17","resolutionWidth":"1920","resolutionHeight":"1280","ip":"63.29.38.211"}' http://localhost:9393/sources/jumpstartlab/data
```

Find the Ruby JSON docs [here](http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0/libdoc/json/rdoc/JSON.html).

Our application should process the request with one of the 4 following outcomes.

* 1. __Missing Payload__ - 400 Bad Request
  * If the payload is missing, return status `400 Bad Request` with a descriptive error message.
* 2. __Already Received Request__ - 403 Forbidden
  * If the request payload has already been received return status `403 Forbidden` with a descriptive error message.
* 3. __Application Not Registered__ - 403 Forbidden
  * When data is submitted to an application URL that does not exist, return a `403 Forbidden` with a descriptive error message.
* 4. __Success__ - 200 OK
  * When the request contains a unique payload return status `200 OK`.

### Iteration 6

Now that we have a site up and endpoints for our clients to register their applications and submit payload data for their applications, our clients want a place to go to view the statistics we have generated for their applications.

We'll want an endpoint for a client to see their aggregate site data:

```
http://yourapplication:port/sources/:IDENTIFIER
```

When the IDENTIFIER exists and a Client goes to their endpoint they should be able to view statistics for:

* Average Response time across all payloads
* Max Response time across all payloads
* Min Response time across all payloads
* Most frequent request type
* List of all HTTP verbs used
* List of URLs listed from most requested to least requested
* Web browser breakdown across all payloads
* OS breakdown across all payloads
* Screen Resolutions across all payloads (resolutionWidth x resolutionHeight)

When an identifier does not exist return a page that displays the following:

* Message that the identifier does not exist

When an identifier does exist, but no payload data has been submitted for the source.

* Message that no payload data has been received for this source

__Keep in mind the difference between instance methods and class methods in ActiveRecord. A class method will be looking at all of the records in your database, and an instance method is already referring to a particular instance/row of data. If we know a particular instance we can easily use ActiveRecord to find any of the related objects.__

### Populate/Seed data

Now that you have everything set up and ready to go for accepting data submitted by clients, you may notice that it kind of sucks to have to write a cURL command for every payload. [Here](https://github.com/turingschool/rush_hour_test_script) you will find the test script that will send a bunch of clients info and a bunch of payloads. Follow the directions and with one command you will have a bunch of data for your app.

### Iteration 7

We also have stats we generated that are specific to a Client's URLs. Let's create a view that will show our URL specific stats.

The URL we will create for this will be:

```
http://yourapplication:port/sources/:IDENTIFIER/urls/:RELATIVEPATH

Examples:

http://yourapplication:port/sources/jumpstartlab/urls/blog
http://yourapplication:port/sources/jumpstartlab/urls/article/1
http://yourapplication:port/sources/jumpstartlab/urls/about
```

First - let's set up our client's specific statistics to have the URLs link to their respective URL specific page.

on the page that is found at this endpoint:

```
http://yourapplication:port/sources/:IDENTIFIER
```

make sure you have: Hyperlinks of each url to view url specific data.


If the url for the identifier __DOES__ exist let's display the url specific stats in this view:

* Max Response time
* Min Response time
* A list of response times across all payloads listed from longest response time to shortest response time.
* Average Response time for this URL
* HTTP Verb(s) associated with this URL
* Three most popular referrers
* Three most popular user agents

If the url for the identifier __DOES NOT__ exist:

* Display a message that the url has not been requested

### Iteration 8

Our client would like to have a 24hour breakdown of their specific events:

```
http://yourapplication:port/sources/IDENTIFIER/events/EVENTNAME

Examples:

http://yourapplication:port/sources/jumpstartlab/events/startedRegistration
http://yourapplication:port/sources/jumpstartlab/events/addedSocialThroughPromptA
http://yourapplication:port/sources/jumpstartlab/events/addedSocialThroughPromptB
```

Implement a hour by hour breakdown of when the event was received. How many were shown at noon? at 1pm? at 2pm? Do it for all 24 hours. Also, display on this page the overall number of times the specific event was received.

When the event has not been defined:
Display a message that no event with the given name has been defined and then a hyperlink to the Application Events Index.


## Extensions

### Javascript to Send Payload

Currently the only way to get data to our app is to:

1.) Use the browser to send a request through the user interface

2.) send a cUrl request from our terminal to the correct endpoint.

For this extension, write some JavaScript/AJAX that you can give a client to embed in their site that will automate sending the Payload for a specific page from the client's site to your app.

### Deleting Account

For this extension implement a feature that allows a customer to delete their account and all their associated data. Be sure to only allow a client to delete their own account.
